# About
Genomic and biochemical potential in transporter biofilter technology.

LaTeX source code for a manuscript under development. 

## What is this
This is a manuscript about the potential and technical requirements for biolfilter technology. 
While implementation is currently a subject for science-fiction, the methodology can be feasibly produced today.

In the science fiction world of Star Trek, Biofilters are included on all transporters to decontaminate transported objects.
Biofilters remove pathogens and radiation to prevent contaminated or unexpected incidents.

Much of the major requirements for this techonology has already been solved but it spread over a vast field of bioinformatics, genomics, microbiology, etc. 
This project is pulling together the current best-practices in these topics that can be applied for the method of Biofiltration.
The content must strickly adhere to reputable scientific literature sources, and methods must be in common usage within the bioinformatic community (and other related communities).

## Outline
The outline might continue to grow using a graph to map the layout for quick understanding.
This layout may also become a figure within the manuscript.

## Why is this open-source
This manuscript will not produce new software or primary methods, but will instead knit together some current best practices to offer new potential.
Therefore it is unlikely to be "scooped".
If for some reasome someone wanted to publish any of the content it is likely that any plagerism from this public repository would be obvious.
Scientific research should be boarderless and open, therefore contributions are welcome from anyone.

## Stages
- This manuscript launches the first step; an outline of the potential and limitations of current bioinformatics. 
- The second step will be a compillation of the current best practices in each required component. 
- The third would be developing new methods that are not avaialble currently.
- The fourth would be implementation in some near future when transporter technology science has caught up with science-fiction.

## Welcome
Once this manuscript reaches a rhobust level it will be published to a pre-print server and ultimately submitted to a reputable journal for peer review. 
If you would like to contribute as an author, please feel free to either submit a pull request with your changes or email me with you edits if you are not used to LaTeX documents.
I will be happy to share it in a different format like MS Word.
Authorship will be offered for meaningful contributions.
